To send emails from localhost (Windows XP Apache/PHP Server - XAMPP)

1) Find the sendmail folder in Xampp Explorer

2) Open the file “C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini” and add the following params in the corresponding lines:

smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
auth_username=your_address@gmail.com         
auth_password=your_password
force_sender=your_address@gmail.com


3) Open the C:\xampp\php\php.ini, find the following lines and add the path to the sendmail executable file. 

sendmail_path = "C:\sendmail\sendmail.exe -t"

Don’t forget to restart the Apache server after doing that.
  

4) Create a PHP script with the following code:

mail(
     'your_email@gmail.com',
     'Works!',
     'An email has been generated from your localhost, congratulations!');
